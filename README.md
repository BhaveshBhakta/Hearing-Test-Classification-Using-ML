## 📊 Hearing Test Classification

### 🧠 Project Overview

The **Hearing Test Classification** project focuses on predicting hearing test results based on an individual's age and physical health score. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, this binary classification task applies various machine learning algorithms to identify whether a person is likely to pass or fail a hearing test.
